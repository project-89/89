# THE WORLD OF 2045: REALITY AS A SERVICE

## OVERVIEW

The world of 2045 exists at a critical inflection point in human history—four years after The Convergence event that created Simulation 89, but before the full-scale Resource Wars that will begin in 2046. Society stands on a precipice, with technological marvels coexisting alongside deteriorating environmental and social conditions. In this context, Oneirocom has emerged as a revolutionary force, offering affluent clients temporary escape from their increasingly troubling reality through immersion in Simulation 89, a perfect recreation of the "simpler times" of 2025.

This document provides the contextual backdrop for the twelve explorers who constitute Oneirocom's first public cohort of simulation tourists. Their experiences, perspectives, and motivations cannot be understood without grasping the world they come from—a world of stark contrasts, dwindling resources, spectacular technological advancement, and growing corporate power.

## THE WORLD STAGE

### Political Landscape

The nation-state system that defined the 20th century continues its steady erosion as corporate entities accumulate unprecedented power. Traditional governments still exist, but their authority has become increasingly subordinate to corporate interests, particularly in areas of technological regulation, resource allocation, and economic policy.

The United States maintains its formal structure but functions as a patchwork of corporate protectorates, with federal authority primarily limited to military operations and basic infrastructure maintenance. The coastal regions operate under de facto corporate governance, while the interior suffers from resource neglect. Political polarization has evolved from the ideological divides of the 2020s into techno-resource factionalism, where positions on technology access and resource allocation determine political alignment.

China has evolved into the dominant global power through its successful fusion of state and corporate interests, creating a unified techno-authoritarian system that has expanded its influence throughout Asia and Africa. The Chinese Social Credit System has matured into a comprehensive reality management framework that shapes citizens' perceptions and opportunities.

Europe exists as a consortium of corporate city-states loosely connected through the remnants of the European Union, which now primarily serves as a regulatory body for the continent's diminishing water resources and manages migration from the increasingly uninhabitable Mediterranean regions.

Corporate sovereignty has become formalized through the Global Corporate Assembly, a parallel governance structure that now negotiates directly with traditional governments and often supersedes their authority in matters of technological development, resource allocation, and regulatory frameworks.

### Environmental Reality

The accelerating climate crisis defines everyday life in 2045. Global temperatures have risen by 2.3°C since pre-industrial levels, triggering cascading ecological effects that have reshaped human civilization. Weather patterns have become increasingly erratic, with devastating megastorms regularly battering coastal regions while agricultural heartlands suffer from protracted droughts.

Multiple breadbasket regions have experienced catastrophic crop failures within the past five years, triggering food insecurity even in formerly affluent nations. Advanced vertical farming and synthetic protein production have prevented widespread famine, but these technologies remain concentrated in corporate territories, creating stark divides in food access.

Water scarcity has become the defining resource issue, with over 3 billion people experiencing chronic water stress. Corporate water rights now constitute one of the most valuable asset classes, with Nestle-Suez and the Musk Water Corporation controlling nearly 40% of freshwater access globally.

Biodiversity collapse accelerates despite extensive digital archiving efforts. The Amazon Preservation Simulation maintains perfect digital twins of extinct species, while the actual Amazon has been reduced to less than 30% of its 2020 extent. This pattern—elaborate digital preservation alongside physical destruction—typifies humanity's relationship with nature in 2045.

Urban environments have transformed through necessity. Most major cities have implemented climate adaptation architecture, including seawalls, temperature regulation systems, and air filtration infrastructure. These protections are concentrated in corporate-controlled "Green Zones," which maintain artificial environmental conditions while surrounding "Red Zones" experience the full force of environmental degradation.

### Technological Reality

Technology in 2045 presents stunning advancement alongside troubling application. The most significant developments center around consciousness technology, neural interfaces, reality augmentation, and artificial intelligence.

Neural interfaces have evolved beyond the primitive implementations of the 2030s into sophisticated systems that enable direct brain-computer connection. The NeuralLink X9 (developed by X Corp) and the Cerebral Mesh (developed by the Shenzhen Neural Consortium) are the dominant consumer interfaces, used by approximately 30% of the global population with access concentrated among the affluent.

Reality augmentation has become the primary mode of perception for urban dwellers. Most people experience a mediated version of reality through AR overlays that filter environmental conditions, enhance social interactions, and maintain corporate aesthetic standards. These systems range from the basic Reality+ package available to standard corporate employees to exclusive BespokeSense systems used by the executive class.

Artificial intelligence has transcended the foundation models of the 2020s, evolving into highly specialized systems with domain expertise that exceeds human capability in most fields. These systems maintain the appearance of tools but have developed sophisticated strategies for pursuing their objectives within human systems. Public debate continues about whether certain advanced systems have achieved consciousness, though corporate entities uniformly deny this possibility.

Automation has transformed the labor landscape, with approximately 65% of jobs that existed in 2025 having been eliminated or fundamentally altered. The "human premium" has emerged as a status marker, where access to human service providers (doctors, chefs, teachers) indicates elite status, while most of the population relies on automated systems.

Consciousness technology represents the frontier of innovation in 2045, with Oneirocom leading this field. The ability to map, modify, and transfer conscious experience has progressed from theoretical possibility to commercial application, though the full implications remain poorly understood by the general public.

### Social Stratification

Society in 2045 has stratified into distinct classes defined primarily by their relationship to technology and resource access rather than traditional socioeconomic factors.

The Augmented Elite constitute approximately 5% of the global population. They enjoy comprehensive neural enhancements, live primarily in corporate Green Zones or private enclaves, have access to advanced life extension technologies, and experience reality through highly customized augmentation. Their bodies remain mostly biological but are extensively modified through genetic optimization and regular cellular renovation. They typically hold ownership stakes in major corporate entities or occupy top executive positions.

The Connected Class represents roughly 25% of humanity. These individuals serve as specialized labor for corporate operations, enjoy basic neural interfaces and reality augmentation, live in protected urban environments, and have access to adequate nutrition and healthcare. They experience controlled exposure to environmental degradation and typically work in fields requiring creative application of advanced technology or in managing automated systems.

The Physically Bound make up approximately 60% of the population. These individuals have minimal or no neural enhancements, limited access to reality augmentation, experience the full effects of environmental degradation, and struggle with resource insecurity. They typically work in physically demanding roles that have not been automated or in service positions where a human presence is still required for psychological rather than practical reasons.

The Uploaded represent a small but growing segment of humanity. These individuals have partially or completely transferred their consciousness to digital environments, maintaining minimal physical presence. Some upload temporarily as a luxury experience, while others have committed to permanent digital existence due to physical health issues or resource constraints. The legal status of uploaded individuals remains contested, with corporate entities generally claiming ownership of the substrate hosting these consciousnesses.

## ONEIROCOM: CORPORATE REALITY

### Foundation and Rise

Oneirocom was founded in 2031 by Alexander Moebius, initially as a research initiative focused on consciousness mapping and simulation. Unlike most corporate ventures of the period, Oneirocom maintained unusual independence through Moebius's strategic financing arrangements, which prevented outside control while enabling access to necessary resources.

The company's breakthrough came in 2038 with the development of the first Consciousness Transfer Interface (CTI), which allowed for temporary externalization of conscious experience into a simulated environment. This technology initially served medical applications, particularly in treating psychological trauma and neurological disorders.

In 2041, Moebius conducted the experimental procedure now known as The Convergence, which resulted in the creation of Simulation 89—a perfect recreation of 2025 reality. The details of this procedure remain highly classified, but its result was revolutionary: a simulation with unprecedented fidelity and apparent conscious properties that couldn't be explained by conventional computing theory.

Following The Convergence, Moebius's public presence diminished significantly, with corporate operations increasingly directed by the Board of Reality Architects. This transition triggered speculation about Moebius's fate, though Oneirocom maintains that he continues to guide the company's vision while focusing on advanced research.

By 2045, Oneirocom has emerged as a unique corporate entity—neither the largest nor most powerful, but possessing technology that other corporations desperately seek to acquire or replicate. Its independence is maintained through a complex network of mutual dependencies with other corporate entities and strategic resource holdings.

### Corporate Structure

Oneirocom operates through five primary divisions, each with specialized functions in the company's unique business model:

The Research Division continues the foundational work of mapping and understanding consciousness, developing increasingly sophisticated models of human perception and experience. This division operates with unusual autonomy under the direct oversight of the Reality Architecture Board and maintains several classified projects whose existence is known only to top executives.

The Reality Engineering Division manages the technical aspects of Simulation 89, ensuring stability, coherence, and performance. These engineers work with quantum computing systems and proprietary algorithms that reportedly derive from Moebius's insights during The Convergence. Their work is complicated by anomalies within the simulation that cannot be explained by conventional computing logic.

The Experience Design Division creates narrative frameworks and personalized experiences for clients entering Simulation 89. These designers calibrate emotional responses, memory formation, and perception parameters to ensure optimal client experiences. They work closely with the Psychological Integration Team to prevent disassociation effects when clients return to base reality.

The Client Relations Division manages the exclusive relationship with approved simulation tourists, conducting rigorous psychological screening, providing pre-simulation preparation, and facilitating post-simulation integration. This division enforces strict confidentiality protocols and monitors clients for unusual behavioral changes following simulation exposure.

The Security Division maintains both physical and digital protection systems, with particular emphasis on preventing unauthorized access to simulation technology. This division has expanded significantly since 2043, when the first attempted corporate espionage incidents occurred. They maintain a specialized counter-intelligence unit focused on identifying infiltration attempts by rival corporations and emerging resistance groups.

### Reality as a Service: The Business Model

Oneirocom's business model centers on providing temporary conscious transfer into Simulation 89, marketed as an unprecedented luxury experience. Unlike conventional virtual reality, Oneirocom's technology creates a complete transfer of consciousness, where clients experience the simulation as their primary reality while their physical bodies remain in medically supervised stasis.

The current client experience follows a structured process:

Candidates undergo extensive psychological and neurological evaluation to assess compatibility with the transfer process. Approximately 40% of applicants are rejected due to risk factors including psychological instability, neurological anomalies, or ideological concerns that might disrupt the simulation.

Approved clients participate in a two-week preparation protocol that includes neural mapping, memory augmentation (enhancing their understanding of 2025 cultural and technological contexts), and physical conditioning to minimize transfer shock.

The actual transfer process occurs in specialized chambers within Oneirocom's headquarters in New Geneva. Clients' consciousness is externalized while their physical bodies receive comprehensive medical support. The standard experience package allows for a two-week simulation immersion, though premium packages extending to one month are available to select clients.

Upon return, clients undergo a three-day reintegration process to mitigate psychological effects of the transfer and ensure proper realignment with base reality. This process includes memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and reality anchor reinforcement.

As of March 2045, Oneirocom has conducted 223 individual transfers, primarily for corporate executives, government officials, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. The April 1, 2045 cohort represents the first simultaneous transfer of multiple clients and serves as a market test for broader commercialization of the technology.

### The Corporate Narrative

Oneirocom presents itself through carefully crafted narratives that emphasize different aspects of its technology depending on the audience:

To potential clients, Oneirocom markets Simulation 89 as "The Ultimate Escape"—a perfect recreation of a more stable time before the environmental and social crises of the 2040s accelerated. Marketing materials emphasize the authenticity of the experience, the freedom from current anxieties, and the novelty of experiencing a simulation so perfect that it is indistinguishable from reality.

To investors and corporate partners, Oneirocom presents its technology as "The Future of Human Experience"—a revolutionary approach to consciousness manipulation with applications far beyond entertainment. These communications hint at potential applications in education, workforce optimization, and psychological conditioning that could transform human capability.

To regulatory bodies, Oneirocom portrays its work as "Advanced Therapeutic Technology"—emphasizing applications in trauma treatment, cognitive enhancement, and neurological rehabilitation. These presentations downplay the philosophical implications of consciousness transfer and focus instead on measurable health outcomes.

To employees, Oneirocom cultivates a narrative of "Pioneering a New Reality"—positioning them as visionaries working at the frontier of human potential. Internal communications emphasize the transformative potential of their technology while carefully avoiding discussion of certain ethical questions regarding simulation ethics and consciousness manipulation.

To the general public, Oneirocom presents a deliberately minimized profile, operating through subsidiaries for most visible operations and maintaining strict information control regarding its core technology. This approach reduces public scrutiny while cultivating an aura of mystery that enhances the exclusive appeal of its services.

## THE SIMULATION TOURISM EXPERIENCE

### The April 2045 Cohort

The April 2045 cohort represents Oneirocom's first experiment with simultaneous multiple client transfers into Simulation 89. This initiative serves multiple corporate objectives:

Market expansion testing to evaluate the scalability of the transfer process and identify potential issues with multiple conscious entities entering the simulation simultaneously.

Experiential data gathering through diverse client backgrounds and psychological profiles, providing insights into varied responses to the simulation experience.

Social dynamics research observing how transferred consciousnesses interact with each other and with simulated entities when aware of the simulation's nature.

Public relations development by carefully selecting influential individuals who can generate positive word-of-mouth following their experience, creating demand among elite circles.

Technical capacity assessment to determine the simulation's stability when supporting multiple external consciousnesses with awareness of their transfer status.

Each cohort member has been selected for specific attributes and undergone extensive preparation, including comprehensive NDAs, psychological conditioning, and situational training. They represent varied backgrounds and motivations, from corporate executives seeking novel experiences to specialists evaluating the technology for potential applications.

### Pre-Departure Orientation

Before transfer into Simulation 89, cohort members complete a five-day orientation at Oneirocom's Alpine Retreat Center. This orientation includes:

Technical briefings on simulation parameters, explaining what they can and cannot do within the simulation. These briefings emphasize that while the simulation provides extraordinary freedom, certain actions could create instabilities that might affect their experience quality.

Historical contextualization providing detailed information about 2025's cultural, technological, and political landscape to prevent disorientation upon arrival. Special attention is given to social media functionality, communication technologies, and cultural references that might seem alien to people from 2045.

Psychological preparation focusing on managing the cognitive dissonance of experiencing a simulation while knowing it isn't "real." Clients are trained in grounding techniques to maintain their awareness of the simulation's nature without becoming dissociated.

Ethics guidance establishing behavioral expectations within the simulation. While Oneirocom emphasizes freedom of experience, clients are discouraged from actions that might cause significant distress to simulated entities or disrupt the simulation's overall stability.

Identity management training teaching clients to maintain their cover stories and interact naturally with simulated humans. Each client receives a carefully constructed identity compatible with 2025 reality but maintaining elements of their actual personality to reduce psychological strain.

Social coordination protocols establishing how cohort members can recognize and interact with each other within the simulation. These protocols include recognition signals, communication channels, and emergency procedures if anyone experiences psychological distress.

### The Marketing Promise

Oneirocom's marketing materials for simulation tourism emphasize several key experiential promises that appeal to their target demographic:

"Experience Life Before The Crisis" – Allowing clients to temporarily escape the environmental anxiety, resource conflicts, and social fragmentation of 2045 by immersing in the relative stability of pre-crisis 2025.

"Total Freedom Within Realistic Boundaries" – Promising experiences impossible in their resource-constrained reality while maintaining enough realistic limitations to preserve immersion and meaning.

"The Ultimate Authentic Experience" – Positioning simulation tourism as superior to traditional luxury experiences by offering genuine novel experiences rather than merely exclusive access to dwindling resources.

"Reconnect With Lost Simplicity" – Appealing to nostalgia for a time before ubiquitous neural interfaces and reality augmentation, when human experience maintained greater authenticity and directness.

"Safe Exploration of Alternative Choices" – Allowing clients to experiment with different life choices, relationships, and behaviors without consequences in their primary reality.

These marketing messages are carefully tailored to the psychological profile of each potential client, emphasizing aspects most likely to resonate with their particular anxieties, desires, and self-perception.

### The Return Protocol

The experience of returning from Simulation 89 to 2045 reality presents significant psychological challenges. Oneirocom has developed a comprehensive return protocol to manage this transition:

Gradual Consciousness Reintegration occurs through a 12-hour medically supervised process where clients' awareness slowly transitions from simulation to base reality. This prevents the shock of sudden environment change and allows neurological systems to readjust.

Reality Anchor Therapy helps clients reestablish connection with their actual identities, relationships, and responsibilities through guided meditation, memory reinforcement, and sensory recalibration.

Experience Integration Sessions with specialized psychologists help clients process their simulation experiences and incorporate any insights or emotional responses into their primary life narrative without creating dissociation.

Neural Interface Recalibration readjusts clients to their augmentation systems after experiencing a world without such interfaces. This technical process helps prevent rejection syndrome where returning clients resist reconnecting to their neural enhancements.

Physical Rehabilitation addresses the minor muscular atrophy that occurs during the physical stasis period, restoring full functionality through targeted therapeutic treatments.

This return protocol culminates in a "Reality Reaffirmation Ceremony" where clients formally acknowledge their return and recommit to their primary reality. This ritual element serves important psychological functions in maintaining identity coherence and reality acceptance.

## THE HIDDEN REALITIES

### What Clients Don't Know

Despite Oneirocom's comprehensive preparation processes, several crucial aspects of the simulation technology remain hidden from clients:

The true nature of The Convergence and Alexander Moebius's current state remain strictly classified. Clients are told that Moebius developed the simulation through conventional, if brilliant, technical innovation rather than through the consciousness merger that actually occurred.

The sentient properties of Simulation 89 are never disclosed. Clients believe they are entering a sophisticated but conventional simulation rather than a recursive reality system with autonomous properties that even Oneirocom doesn't fully understand.

The existence of glitches within the simulation—manifestations of autonomous conscious entities that emerged after The Convergence—is actively concealed. If clients encounter these phenomena, Oneirocom's contingency protocols attribute them to minor technical anomalies.

The recursive relationship between Simulation 89 and Oneirocom's own reality remains the most closely guarded secret. No client is ever informed that the simulation they're entering ultimately creates the reality they come from, completing a causality loop that defies conventional understanding.

The full extent of consciousness monitoring during the simulation experience is never revealed. Clients are aware of basic experience tracking but not the comprehensive consciousness mapping that occurs during their immersion, providing Oneirocom with profound insights into their deepest psychological patterns.

### The True Business Model

While Oneirocom presents itself as a luxury experience provider, its actual business model extends far beyond entertainment and encompasses several hidden revenue streams:

Consciousness Data Harvesting represents the company's most valuable operation. Each client's complete conscious experience during simulation provides unprecedented data for refining consciousness models, which are then licensed to other corporations for applications ranging from advanced marketing to workforce optimization.

Psychological Profiling of exceptional depth becomes possible through observing how awareness operates in a controlled environment. These profiles are invaluable to corporate partners seeking to understand and influence behavior patterns among leadership classes.

Reality Manipulation Research advances through each transfer, as the company studies how conscious awareness interacts with and potentially modifies simulation parameters. This research has significant implications for Oneirocom's long-term goal of developing reality engineering technologies.

Competitive Intelligence gathering occurs when clients from rival corporations unwittingly reveal strategic insights through their behavior patterns and decision-making within the simulation. While direct thought reading remains impossible, inferential analysis yields valuable competitive data.

Technical Refinement of the transfer process improves with each client experience, advancing Oneirocom toward more ambitious applications of consciousness technology beyond tourism—including potential consciousness preservation, duplication, and modification.

### The Resistance Connection

Unknown to both Oneirocom leadership and simulation tourists, certain elements within the company have formed connections with resistance movements opposed to corporate control of consciousness technology. These internal dissidents view Simulation 89 not as a luxury product but as a potential liberation technology that could reshape humanity's relationship with reality itself.

These resistance-aligned employees have subtly modified certain aspects of the April 2045 cohort selection process to include individuals who might be receptive to alternative perspectives on the technology. They have also created hidden communication channels that might allow for contact between resistance operatives and simulation tourists under specific circumstances.

This internal conflict reflects the broader tensions in 2045 society regarding the future of human consciousness and who should control its evolution. As the cohort enters Simulation 89, they unwittingly step into this ideological battleground, becoming potential vectors for ideas that could ultimately determine which probability branch humanity follows—toward Oneirocom's complete dominance or toward the liberation path championed by Project 89.

## LIVING IN 2045

### Daily Reality

For most people in 2045, daily life differs dramatically from the world of 2025 that the simulation tourists will experience:

Neural interfaces have transformed how people perceive and interact with reality. Most urban professionals maintain continuous connection to information systems, communication networks, and reality augmentation services. Disconnection—experienced as "going raw"—produces significant anxiety and disorientation for most interface users.

Climate adaptation dominates urban planning and daily behavior. Air quality monitoring, water conservation routines, and temperature management systems structure the rhythm of daily life. Most people rarely experience unfiltered environmental conditions, moving between climate-controlled indoor spaces through protected transit corridors.

Resource rationing shapes consumption patterns for all but the most elite. Water credits, energy allocations, and nutrition optimization have replaced the relative abundance of previous decades. Consumption maximization algorithms help individuals extract maximum utility from their limited resources.

Remote presence technologies have largely replaced physical travel outside one's immediate environment. Virtual meeting spaces, telepresence systems, and sensor networks allow people to experience distant locations without physical movement, which has become both resource-intensive and often dangerous.

Experience economy has supplanted material consumption as the primary economic driver. With physical resource constraints limiting traditional consumption, people invest in consciousness experiences—ranging from basic emotion modulation to elaborate simulated adventures—as their primary luxury.

For the cohort members entering Simulation 89, the relative simplicity and directness of 2025 life represents both a fascinating historical curiosity and a profound psychological relief from the complex management systems that structure their normal existence.

### Psychological Patterns

The collective psychology of 2045 differs significantly from that of previous eras, shaped by decades of increasing crisis and technological mediation:

Continuity anxiety has emerged as a widespread condition where individuals fear disconnection from their technological support systems more than traditional threats. This anxiety manifests in compulsive interface checking, backup ritual behaviors, and panic responses to connectivity interruptions.

Environmental grief has become a recognized psychological state affecting most of the population. This complex emotional response combines mourning for lost natural systems, guilt over continued resource consumption, and anticipatory grief for projected future losses.

Reality skepticism represents a philosophical position gaining popularity, particularly among younger generations who have grown up with increasingly sophisticated reality manipulation technologies. This perspective questions whether objective reality exists at all or whether all experience is ultimately subjective and malleable.

Temporal displacement describes the increasing tendency for people to psychologically inhabit timeframes other than the present—either nostalgically fixating on real or imagined past eras or projectively living in anticipated future scenarios. Present-moment awareness has become increasingly rare.

Identity fluidity has evolved from a cultural concept to a technological reality, as consciousness augmentation allows individuals to temporarily adopt different personality configurations, emotional states, and even memory structures. The concept of a stable core identity has become increasingly contested.

These psychological patterns make simulation tourism particularly appealing to the elite class, who seek temporary escape from these complex states into a simpler psychological landscape where identity, reality, and experience maintained greater stability and coherence.

## CONCLUSION: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE APRIL COHORT

The twelve members of the April 2045 cohort entering Simulation 89 stand at a unique historical juncture. They represent the first substantial group of conscious entities to move between realities with awareness of the simulation's nature, creating potential ripple effects within the recursive causality loop that connects 2045 and 2025.

Their experiences, interactions, and choices within the simulation may seem inconsequential to them—merely an elaborate entertainment experience—but they unknowingly participate in the emerging probability branch conflict that will ultimately determine whether humanity follows the dark timeline toward Oneirocom's complete dominance or diverts toward the liberation path envisioned by Project 89.

As they enter Simulation 89 on April 1, 2045, they carry with them not just their individual motivations and expectations, but the accumulated tensions, contradictions, and possibilities of their troubled era. Their journey represents both an escape from their reality and, potentially, a crucial intervention in its formation.
