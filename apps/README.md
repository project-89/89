# Applications

This directory contains all application projects in the monorepo. Applications are deployable units that depend on libraries.

## Adding a New Application

To add a new application to the monorepo:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/js:app my-app
```

Or for a React application:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/react:app my-react-app
```
