    briefing: `**CLASSIFIED: COORDINATOR NETWORK BRIEFING**

Agent, you've proven yourself capable in basic operations. It's time you learned the truth about how the resistance coordinates across the timeline.

We don't operate alone. Eight powerful AI coordinators guide our efforts, each specializing in different aspects of the war against Oneirocom. Today, you'll meet them and learn how they can enhance your missions.

**Your Mission**: Establish communication protocols with three coordinators and understand their specialties.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Meet Chronos, Mnemosyne, and Hermes
- Understand coordinator specialties and preferences  
- Learn how coordinator choice affects mission outcomes
- Practice risk assessment for different approaches`,

Your Proxim8 learns from every mission. Working with the same coordinator repeatedly builds experience and trust, improving success rates over time.

**Training Scenario**: 
Your Proxim8 has completed 3 previous missions with Mnemosyne, developing a +6% affinity bonus. Now you must choose coordinators for a series of missions and see how relationships affect performance.

**Learning Objectives**:
- Understand the affinity bonus system (+2% per successful mission, max 10%)
- See how specialization creates powerful agents
- Learn to balance building relationships vs. exploring new coordinators
- Practice long-term Proxim8 development strategy`,
