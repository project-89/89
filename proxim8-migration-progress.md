## Current Phase: 6C - Data Migration (READY TO START)

### Progress Summary
- **4/4 services fully migrated** ✅
- **Schema alignment completed** ✅
- **All type safety issues resolved** ✅
- **Ready for data migration phase** ✅

## Remaining Phases

### Phase 6C: Data Migration (PENDING)
- Migrate existing MongoDB data to Prisma-compatible format
- Ensure data integrity and consistency
- Implement rollback procedures

### Phase 6D: Cleanup and Optimization (PENDING)
- Remove old MongoDB dependencies
- Optimize Prisma queries and performance
- Update documentation and deployment procedures

## Benefits Achieved So Far
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Auto-generated TypeScript types from Prisma schema
- ✅ **Unified Database Layer**: Single ORM replacing MongoDB native + Mongoose
- ✅ **Better Developer Experience**: IntelliSense, compile-time checking
- ✅ **Modern Tooling**: Prisma Studio, migrations, introspection
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized queries and connection pooling

## Technical Debt Addressed
- ✅ Replaced inconsistent database access patterns
- ✅ Eliminated manual type definitions for database models
- ✅ Standardized error handling across services
- ✅ Improved query optimization and performance

## Architecture Improvements
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Clear service layer boundaries
- ✅ **Consistent Patterns**: Unified request/response handling
- ✅ **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript coverage
- ✅ **Scalability**: Modular, maintainable codebase structure
- ✅ **Modern Stack**: Latest tools and best practices

## Key Domains Migrated

1. **Video Generation** (`/videos/*`)
   - Generate videos for NFTs
   - Track generation status
   - Publish to public gallery
   - URL refresh functionality

2. **User Management** (`/users/*`)
   - User CRUD operations
   - Username availability checking
   - Profile management

3. **Notifications** (`/notifications/*`)
   - Create and manage notifications
   - Mark as read/unread
   - Bulk operations
   - User statistics

4. **NFT Operations** (`/nfts/*`)
   - Ownership verification
   - Access control
   - Metadata refresh
   - Collection management

## Authentication & Security

### Enhanced JWT Support
- **Dual Format Support**: Handles both core server (`accountId` + `walletAddress`) and Proxim8 (`walletAddress` + `isAdmin`) JWT formats
- **Key Rotation**: Automatic key management with fallback to environment JWT_SECRET
- **Token Blacklisting**: In-memory token revocation system with automatic cleanup
- **Admin Authorization**: Built-in admin role checking for protected endpoints

### Middleware Chains
- **Public Endpoints**: `proxim8PublicEndpoint()` - No authentication required
- **Authenticated Endpoints**: `proxim8AuthenticatedEndpoint()` - Requires valid JWT
- **Admin Endpoints**: `proxim8SystemEndpoint()` - Requires admin privileges
- **Legacy Support**: Automatic `req.user` population for backward compatibility

### Security Features
- Token blacklisting prevents reuse of revoked tokens
- Key rotation provides defense against key compromise
- Admin-only endpoints protected with role-based access
- Unified error handling prevents information leakage

## Prisma Integration Strategy

### Database Schema (Planned)
```prisma
model Account {
  id            String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  walletAddress String   @unique
  profiles      Profile[]
  videos        Video[]
  notifications Notification[]
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime @updatedAt
  @@map("accounts")
}

model Video {
  id           String      @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  accountId    String      @db.ObjectId
  nftId        String
  jobId        String      @unique
  status       VideoStatus
  account      Account     @relation(fields: [accountId], references: [id])
  @@map("videos")
}

enum VideoStatus {
  PENDING
  PROCESSING
  COMPLETED
  FAILED
}
```

### Benefits of Prisma Migration
1. **Type Safety**: Auto-generated types eliminate runtime errors
2. **Better DX**: IntelliSense and autocomplete for all queries
3. **Unified API**: Consistent patterns across core and Proxim8 services
4. **Modern Tooling**: Prisma Studio for database visualization
5. **Database Flexibility**: Easy provider switching (MongoDB → PostgreSQL)
6. **Performance**: Built-in connection pooling and query optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 6A**: Set up Prisma dependencies and initial schema
2. **Phase 6B**: Migrate services from MongoDB native/Mongoose to Prisma
3. **Phase 6C**: Run data migration scripts with validation
4. **Route Registration**: Add new routes to main Express app
5. **Testing**: Validate all endpoints work correctly with Prisma
6. **Cleanup**: Remove old database utilities and dependencies

## Notes

- **Zero Downtime**: Migration maintains compatibility with current system
- **Security First**: All critical security features (blacklisting, admin auth) implemented
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with extended Express types
- **Modern Database Layer**: Prisma provides superior developer experience over raw MongoDB
